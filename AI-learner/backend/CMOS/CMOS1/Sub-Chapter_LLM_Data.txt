Start: CMOS Technology

**CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor)** is a technology used to construct integrated circuits, including microprocessors, microcontrollers, memory chips, and other digital logic circuits. It uses a combination of **p-type** and **n-type** MOSFETs (Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistors).

**Key Feature**: Low static power consumption power is only consumed during switching.

**Why "Complementary"**: It uses both NMOS and PMOS transistors in a complementary way to achieve logic functions.

**Example**: In a CMOS inverter, when the input is high, the NMOS conducts and pulls the output low; when the input is low, the PMOS conducts and pulls the output high.

MOSFETs are the building blocks of CMOS. There are two types:

**NMOS**: Conducts when gate voltage is high.

**PMOS**: Conducts when gate voltage is low.

Each MOSFET has:

**Gate**: Controls the transistor.

**Source** and **Drain**: Current flows from source to drain.

**Substrate**: The body of the transistor (p-type for NMOS, n-type for PMOS).

**Example**: In an NMOS, applying a positive voltage to the gate creates an inversion layer allowing electrons to flow from source to drain.
